# table-impexp
Toolbox for table import/ export in different format (CSV and XLSX for example)

# Current state
- Export API with 2 implementations : CSV and XLSX
- Run also on Android !

# Known issue
- None :-) The bug with Excel date is now fixed !

# RoadMap
- I plan to add an import interface (stream mode too)
- Add export features for XLSX impl (Comments, style, ...)
